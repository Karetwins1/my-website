The reson that I took the class computer science is very simple. I wanted to lern and yes i have never been the smartest kid but i new from the beginning that i will do my best. Was there good reson not to take the class? well yes my average would probability be higher and my work will be easier with out it but i love the class and the teacher it was fun even if i am not so smart.
